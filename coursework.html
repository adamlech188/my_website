                    <dt><u>Introduction to Mathemathical Proofs</u></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Although this class didn't teach me directly programming and software development, nevertheless it was very important one
						to further my understading of Computer Science and programming. 
                        This class exposed me for  the first time to  mathematical  thinking using strict formal logic.It taught me to operate on more
						abstract and conceptual level. I was introduced to set theory , number theory, and function with 
						emphasis on logical justifying claims about
                        mathematical objects. As it turned out, it had enormous importance in Computer Science.
                        This course made me aware how much we rely on unproven assumptions and how to be critical about them.

                    <dd>
                        Design and implementation of object-oriented graphical user interface and computer graphics system. Projects
                        involving basic principles of concurrent and event-driven programming.</br> 
						  The project in this class, provided full game graphics and user interface. I created 
						  all geometrical figures and shapes as components of the game starting first with primitive geometrical shapes 
						  in 3D developed applying fundamental algorithms for clipping, scan conversion, viewing affine and convex linear 
						  transformations, projections and viewing.  After that, the components of the user interface were created: buttons, 
						  text fields and text areas. This project gave very thorough understanding of how the components of graphical user 
						  interface are developed. Since this project simulated a real time game with player connected on the remote server,
						  I also had to apply basic principles of concurrent programming and thread management that exposed me to programming 
						  problems in broader computer-system context. <a class="superscript" title="Click here to see source code"

				    <dt> <u>Introduction to Media Computation</u></dt>
                    <dd> This is the first Computer Science class I have ever taken, where I learned what Computer Science is really about. In this class we learned how to manipulate digital media (mainly images and sound files) using the
                    Java derivative of Python called Jython. We were provided psuedo environment called <a href="http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/cs1315/3137" target="_blank">JES</a> (courtesy of Georgia Tech professor
                    <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~guzdial/" target="_blank">
                    Mark Guzdial</a>) with Java library classes which helped us to manipulate images
                    and sounds. <a href="pic.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> 
                    is the example of what I achieved.<a class="superscript" title="Click here to see source code" href="https://github.com/owenfan/Chroma-Project" target="_blank">Source</a></br>
                    At the end we smoothly transitioned into Java ending up with project that required us to implement principles of object oriented programming.
